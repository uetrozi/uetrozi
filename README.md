Hi, I'm Charlotte! ðŸ‘‹

When I was working as a media educator at a school, the headmaster kept asking me to "fix" their homepage â€” to make it look better, more user-friendly, better structured, and so on. It was a task I really enjoyed, but after a while, I faced some challenges. I wanted to dive deeper into the programming of the site, but I lacked some technical knowledge. There was hardly any documentation, no one to ask for guidance, and most of all, my job description required me to focus on other tasks.

But I couldn't let go. I had found something I genuinely enjoyed doing, and I wanted to do THIS. I quit my job and applied to a coding bootcamp at Spiced Academy. There, I learned the basics of programming â€” but more importantly, I learned that I had made the right decision: programming is something Iâ€™m good at. Itâ€™s something I can build a career in.

Now comes the next challenge: finding a job in software development, with hardly any work experience and at a time when AI is said to make developers obsolete. Itâ€™s tough. And so far, it hasnâ€™t worked out. But Iâ€™m not stopping. I got certified as an ISTQB Foundation Level Tester and enrolled at THB to study media informatics â€” because if I canâ€™t learn on the job, Iâ€™ll learn elsewhere. I will find a way to make my passion my profession. I will make this happen.

Now, if you're currently looking for a software developer with dedication, look no further. Let's find out if your company is the place where my journey is meant to continue.

Letâ€™s talk.
