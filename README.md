### Hi there 👋

I'm Charlotte and I am an aspiring Full Stack Web Developer. I was previously working as a Media Educator at a school where I was constantly asked to fix and upgrade the schools homepage. Since i was not getting paid for that and also lacking a few skills I decided to change both things by learning to code.
I grew up near the Baltic Sea and settled in Berlin 3 years ago, of course close to the Spree so I still have the waterfront nearby. I like climbing, riding the bike and going out to eat altough I spend most of my freetime sitiing next to playgrounds and watching my daughter build sandcastle, which I truly enjoy.
