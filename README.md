# Hi there 👋

I'm Charlotte and I am an aspiring Full Stack Web Developer. 👩🏻‍💻

Working as a Media Educator I was constantly asked to fix homepages. Lacking a few skills for that and also not getting paid accordingly I decided to change both things by learning to code.

I grew up near the Baltic Sea and settled in Berlin 9 years ago, of course close to the Spree so I still have the waterfront nearby. I like climbing, riding the bike and going out to eat altough most of my freetime is spent sitting on playgrounds and watching my daughter build sandcastles, which I truly enjoy.
