About me:

As a former Media Educator I was asked to fix homepages a lot. 

But I did and I liked it and I was good at it. 
So thats what I do now.

I grew up near the Baltic Sea and settled in Berlin 9 years ago. 

In my free time I like to go climbing, riding the bike or going on adventures with my daughter.

Get in contact with me over LinkedIn and if you think about hiring me: 
Do it! I promise: It will be a very good decision. ðŸ˜‰
