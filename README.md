# Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Charlotte and I am a Full Stack Web Developer. 

As a former Media Educator I was asked to fix homepages a lot. 

But I did and I liked it and I was good at it. 
So thats what I do now.

I grew up near the Baltic Sea and settled in Berlin 9 years ago. In my free time I like to go climbing, riding the bike or going on adventures with my daughter.

Get in contact with me over LinkedIn and if you think about hiring me: Do it! I promise: It will be a very good decision. ðŸ˜‰
